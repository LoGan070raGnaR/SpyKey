# SpyKey - An Advanced Keylogger

## Overview
SpyKey is an advanced keylogger project that allows you to monitor and record keystrokes on a target system. It provides a comprehensive set of features for capturing keyboard input and saving it for analysis or surveillance purposes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- **keylogger**: Contains the main keylogger implementation and related files.
- **cryptography**: Includes the decryption file and key generation file.

### keylogger Folder

The keylogger folder contains the following files:

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the keylogger and captures keystrokes.
- *Other files*: Additional files that are called or used by the main script, such as configuration files or utility modules.

### cryptography Folder

The cryptography folder contains the following files:

- `decryption.py`: The script responsible for decrypting the encrypted files generated by the keylogger.
- `generate_key.py`: The script for generating an encryption key to be used by the keylogger.

## Getting Started

To use the SpyKey keylogger, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the keylogger folder.
3. Customize the keylogger settings in `main.py` if needed.
4. Run `main.py` to start the keylogger and begin capturing keystrokes.

## Dependencies

The SpyKey project relies on the following dependencies:

- `python` (version X.X.X): The programming language used for the keylogger implementation.
- `win32clipboard` and `win32con`: Modules for clipboard operations
- `os`: Module for interacting with the operating system
- `cryptography.fernet`: Module for encryption
- `win32gui`: Module for interacting with the Windows GUI
- `sounddevice` and `scipy.io.wavfile`: Modules for audio recording and playback
- `PIL.ImageGrab`: Module for capturing screenshots
- `smtplib`, `email.mime.multipart`, `email.mime.base`, and `email.encoders`: Modules for sending emails
- `platform` and `socket`: Modules for retrieving system information
- `requests.get`: Module for making HTTP requests

Make sure you have these dependencies installed before running the keylogger.

## Creating Python Executable

If you want to create an executable file from the Python scripts, you can use tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze. Follow the steps below to create a standalone executable:

1. Install the required package:

   ```shell
   pip install pyinstaller

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd SpyKey

3. Run the PyInstaller command to generate the executable:

   ```shell
   pyinstaller main.py --onefile

This command creates a single executable file named `main.exe` (Windows) or `main` (Unix-like systems) in the `dist` directory.

4. You can now run the executable directly:

   ```shell
   cd dist
   main


Note: Depending on your operating system, the generated executable may have a different name or extension.

Please note that creating an executable is optional and not necessary for running the SpyKey keylogger. It is provided as a convenience for users who prefer standalone executables.

## Disclaimer

Please note that using keyloggers or any form of surveillance software without proper authorization may be illegal or unethical. Ensure that you comply with the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction before using the SpyKey keylogger.
