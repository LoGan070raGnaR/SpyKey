# SpyKey - An Advanced Keylogger

## Overview
SpyKey is an advanced keylogger project that allows you to monitor and record keystrokes on a target system. It provides a comprehensive set of features for capturing keyboard input and saving it for analysis or surveillance purposes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- **keylogger**: Contains the main keylogger implementation and related files.
- **cryptography**: Includes the decryption file and key generation file.

### keylogger Folder

The keylogger folder contains the following files:

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the keylogger and captures keystrokes.
- *Other files*: Additional files that are called or used by the main script, such as configuration files or utility modules.

### cryptography Folder

The cryptography folder contains the following files:

- `decryption.py`: The script responsible for decrypting the encrypted files generated by the keylogger.
- `generate_key.py`: The script for generating an encryption key to be used by the keylogger.

## Getting Started

To use the SpyKey keylogger, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the keylogger folder.
3. Customize the keylogger settings in `main.py` if needed.
4. Run `main.py` to start the keylogger and begin capturing keystrokes.

## Dependencies

The SpyKey project relies on the following dependencies:

- `python` (version X.X.X): The programming language used for the keylogger implementation.
- `win32clipboard` and `win32con`: Modules for clipboard operations
- `os`: Module for interacting with the operating system
- `cryptography.fernet`: Module for encryption
- `win32gui`: Module for interacting with the Windows GUI
- `sounddevice` and `scipy.io.wavfile`: Modules for audio recording and playback
- `PIL.ImageGrab`: Module for capturing screenshots
- `smtplib`, `email.mime.multipart`, `email.mime.base`, and `email.encoders`: Modules for sending emails
- `platform` and `socket`: Modules for retrieving system information
- `requests.get`: Module for making HTTP requests

Make sure you have these dependencies installed before running the keylogger.
